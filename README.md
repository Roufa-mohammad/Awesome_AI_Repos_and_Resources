### This REPO contains all the Github repositories that i found useful in the process of Learning and Implementing AI Usecases.

1. [LibfaceID](https://github.com/richmondu/libfaceid), is implemented as a one stop for detection, liveness check, face recognition and emotion detection.

3. [Avatarify](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify), using First Order Motion Model, creates photos to talk, has a demo of showing it in video conferencing apps. more [here too](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/100-days-of-code/blob/master/post-log.md#avatarify-1)

4. [Matterport Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN), is a tensorflow implementation of Mask-RCNN. Pretty easy to use. REsults below

5. [Face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js), is a java script for Face dtection, Recognition, Emotion Detection, Age, Gender detection and for landmarks too. more [here](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html)

6. [DeepFace](https://github.com/ildoonet/deepface) is a face detection and recognition model using tensorflow with mobilenet and ssd

7. [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet), for Face Recognition in Tensorflow with 10K stars

8. [CenterMask2](https://github.com/youngwanLEE/centermask2) on top of Detectron2, is way faster and lighter than Mask R-CNN using Pytorch.

9. [Genetic drawing](https://github.com/anopara/genetic-drawing) just with python, opencv, matplotlib in jupyter notebook has impressive results, check below

### Audio
1. [Transformer TTS](https://github.com/as-ideas/TransformerTTS), is implementation of Non Auto regressive transformer based Neural network for Text to Speech.
- Audio results [here](https://as-ideas.github.io/TransformerTTS/)
- More related to TExt to Speech is [here](https://github.com/as-ideas)

2. [Voice Activity Detection](https://github.com/filippogiruzzi/voice_activity_detection) to Classify Noise or Speech audio using tensorflow

3. Mozilla [Deepspeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) for Speech to Text with close results.

4. [DeepXI](https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi) for Noise Supression


### Text
1. [Text summarizer](https://github.com/as-ideas/headliner)
2. [bentrevett pytorch seq2seq](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq), is a implementation of few sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with PyTorch and TorchText.

### OpenCV
1. [Tennis shot counter](https://github.com/prateekjoshi565/Tennis-Shot-Counter), is a real time score counter on your wall everytime you hit a wall in particular spot while playing tennis.
